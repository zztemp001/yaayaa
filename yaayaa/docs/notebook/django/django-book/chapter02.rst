==========================
Chapter 2: Getting Started
==========================

Installing Django is a multi-step process, due to the multiple moving parts in
modern Web development environments. In this chapter, we'll walk you through
how to install the framework and its few dependencies.

Because Django is "just" Python code, it runs anywhere Python does -- including
on some cell phones! But this chapter just covers the common scenarios for
Django installations. We'll assume you're installing it either on a
desktop/laptop machine or a server.

Later, in Chapter 12, we'll cover how to deploy Django to a production site.

Installing Python
=================

Django itself is written purely in Python, so the first step in installing the
framework is to make sure you have Python installed.

Python Versions
---------------

The core Django framework (version 1.4+) works with any Python version from 2.5
to 2.7, inclusive. Django's optional GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
support requires Python 2.5 to 2.7.

If you're not sure which version of Python to install and you have complete
freedom over the decision, pick the latest one in the 2.x series: version 2.7.
Although Django works equally well with any version from 2.5 to 2.7, the later
versions of Python have performance improvements and additional language
features you might like to use in your applications. Plus, certain third-party
Django add-ons that you might want to use might require a version newer than
Python 2.5, so using a later version of Python keeps your options open.

.. admonition:: Django and Python 3.x

    At the time of writing, Python 3.3 has been released, but Django
    only supports it experimentally. This is because the Python 3.x series 
    introduces a substantial number of backwards-incompatible changes to the
    language itself, and, as a result, many major Python libraries and
    frameworks, including Django (as of version 1.4), have not yet caught up.

    Django 1.5 is slated to support Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2.  However,
    support for Python 3.2 is considered a "preview", which means the
    Django developers are not yet confident enough to promise
    stability in production.  For that, they suggest you wait until
    Django 1.6.

Installation
------------

If you're on Linux or Mac OS X, you probably have Python already installed.
Type ``python`` at a command prompt (or in Applications/Utilities/Terminal, in
OS X). If you see something like this, then Python is installed::

    Python 2.7.3rc2 (default, Apr 22 2012, 22:30:17)
    [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Otherwise, you'll need to download and install Python. It's fast and easy, and
detailed instructions are available at http://www.python.org/download/

Installing Django
=================

At any given time, two distinct versions of Django are available to you: the
latest official release and the bleeding-edge development version. The version you
decide to install depends on your priorities. Do you want a stable and tested
version of Django, or do you want a version containing the latest features,
perhaps so you can contribute to Django itself, at the expense of stability?

We'd recommend sticking with an official release, but it's important to know
that the development version exists, because you'll find it mentioned
in the documentation and by members of the community.

Installing an Official Release
------------------------------

Official releases have a version number, such as 1.4.2, 1.4.1 or 1.4, and the latest
one is always available at http://www.djangoproject.com/download/.

If you're on a Linux distribution that includes a package of Django, it's a
good idea to use the distributor's version. That way, you'll get security
updates along with the rest of your system packages.

If you don't have access to a prepackaged version, you can download and install
the framework manually. To do so, first download the tarball, which will be
named something like ``Django-1.4.2.tar.gz``. (It doesn't matter which
local directory you download this file into; the installation process will put
Django's files in the right place.) Then, unzip it and run ``setup.py install``,
as you do with most Python libraries.

Here's how that process looks on Unix systems:

#. ``tar xzvf Django-1.4.2.tar.gz``
#. ``cd Django-*``
#. ``sudo python setup.py install``

On Windows, we recommend using 7-Zip (http://www.djangoproject.com/r/7zip/)
to unzip ``.tar.gz`` files. Once you've unzipped the file, start up a DOS
shell (the "Command Prompt") with administrator privileges and run the
following command from within the directory whose name starts with ``Django-``::

    python setup.py install

In case you're curious: Django's files will be installed into your Python
installation's ``site-packages`` directory -- a directory where Python looks
for third-party libraries. Usually it's in a place like
``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages``.

Installing the "Development" Version
------------------------------------

Django uses Git (http://git-scm.com) for its source control. The latest and
greatest Django development version available from Django's official Git
repository (https://github.com/django/django). You should consider installing
this version if you want to work on the bleeding edge, or if you want to
contribute code to Django itself.

Git is a free, open source distributed revision-control system, and the Django
team uses it to manage changes to the Django codebase. You can download and
install Git from http://git-scm.com/download but it is easier to install with
your operating system's package manager. You can use Git to grab the very latest
Django source code and, at any given time, you can update your local version of
the Django code to get the latest changes and improvements made by Django
developers.

When using the development version, keep in mind there's no guarantee things
won't be broken at any given moment. With that said, though, some members of the
Django team run production sites on the development version, so they have an
incentive to keep it stable.

To grab the latest Django, follow these steps:

#. Make sure you have Git installed. You can get the
   software free from http://git-scm.com/, and you can find
   excellent documentation at http://git-scm.com/documentation.

#. Clone the repository using the command ``git clone https://github.com/django/django djmaster``

#. Locate your Python installation's ``site-packages`` directory. Usually
   it's in a place like ``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages``. If you have
   no idea, type this command from a command prompt::

       python -c 'import sys, pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)'

   The resulting output should include your ``site-packages`` directory.

#. Within the ``site-packages`` directory, create a file called
   ``djmaster.pth`` and edit it to contain the full path to your ``djmaster``
   directory to it. For example, the file could just contain this line::

       /path/to/djmaster

#. Place ``djmaster/django/bin`` on your system PATH. This directory
   includes management utilities such as ``django-admin.py``.

.. admonition:: Tip:

    If ``.pth`` files are new to you, you can learn more about them at
    http://www.djangoproject.com/r/python/site-module/.

After downloading from Git and following the preceding steps, there's no
need to run ``python setup.py install``-- you've just done the work by hand!

Because the Django code changes often with bug fixes and feature additions,
you'll probably want to update it every once in a while. To update the code,
just run the command ``git pull origin master`` from within the ``djmaster``
directory. When you run that command, Git will contact
https://github.com/django/django, determine whether any of Django's code has
changed, and update your local version of the code with any changes that have
been made since you last updated. It's quite slick.

Finally, if you use Django development version, you should know how to figure
out which version of Django you're running. Knowing your version number is
important if you ever need to reach out to the community for help, or if you
submit improvements to the framework. In these cases, you should tell people the
revision, also known as a "commit," that you're using. To find out your current
commit, type "git log -1" from within the ``django`` directory, and look for the
identifier after "commit". This number changes each time Django is changed,
whether through a bug fix, feature addition, documentation improvement or
anything else.

Testing the Django installation
===============================

For some post-installation positive feedback, take a moment to test whether the
installation worked. In a command shell, change into another directory (e.g.,
*not* the directory that contains the ``django`` directory) and start the
Python interactive interpreter by typing ``python``. If the installation was
successful, you should be able to import the module ``django``:

    >>> import django
    >>> django.VERSION
    (1, 4, 2, 'final', 0)

.. admonition:: Interactive Interpreter Examples

    The Python interactive interpreter is a command-line program that lets you
    write a Python program interactively. To start it, run the command
    ``python`` at the command line.

    Throughout this book, we feature example Python interactive interpreter
    sessions. You can recognize these examples by the triple
    greater-than signs (``>>>``), which designate the interpreter's prompt. If
    you're copying examples from this book, don't copy those greater-than signs.

    Multiline statements in the interactive interpreter are padded with three
    dots (``...``). For example::

        >>> print """This is a
        ... string that spans
        ... three lines."""
        This is a
        string that spans
        three lines.
        >>> def my_function(value):
        ...     print value
        >>> my_function('hello')
        hello

    Those three dots at the start of the additional lines are inserted by the
    Python shell -- they're not part of our input. We include them here to be
    faithful to the actual output of the interpreter. If you copy our examples
    to follow along, don't copy those dots.

Setting Up a Database
=====================

At this point, you could very well begin writing a Web application with Django,
because Django's only hard-and-fast prerequisite is a working Python
installation. However, odds are you'll be developing a *database-driven* Web
site, in which case you'll need to configure a database server.

If you just want to start playing with Django, skip ahead to the
"Starting a Project" section -- but keep in mind that all the examples in this
book assume you have a working database set up.

Django supports four database engines:

* PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/)
* SQLite 3 (http://www.sqlite.org/)
* MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/)
* Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/)

For the most part, all the engines here work equally well with the core Django
framework. (A notable exception is Django's optional GIS support, which is much
more powerful with PostgreSQL than with other databases.) If you're not tied to
any legacy system and have the freedom to choose a database backend, we
recommend PostgreSQL, which achieves a fine balance between cost, features,
speed and stability.

Setting up the database is a two-step process:

* First, you'll need to install and configure the database server itself.
  This process is beyond the scope of this book, but each of the four
  database backends has rich documentation on its Web site. (If you're on
  a shared hosting provider, odds are that they've set this up for you
  already.)

* Second, you'll need to install the Python library for your particular
  database backend. This is a third-party bit of code that allows Python to
  interface with the database. We outline the specific, per-database
  requirements in the following sections.

If you're just playing around with Django and don't want to install a database
server, consider using SQLite. SQLite is unique in the list of supported
databases in that it doesn't require either of the above steps. It merely reads
and writes its data to a single file on your filesystem, and Python versions 2.5
and higher include built-in support for it.

On Windows, obtaining database driver binaries can be frustrating. If you're
eager to jump in, we recommend using Python 2.7 and its built-in support for
SQLite.

Using Django with PostgreSQL
----------------------------

If you're using PostgreSQL, you'll need to install either the ``psycopg`` or
``psycopg2`` package from http://www.djangoproject.com/r/python-pgsql/. We
recommend ``psycopg2``, as it's newer, more actively developed and can be
easier to install. Either way, take note of whether you're using version 1 or
2; you'll need this information later.

If you're using PostgreSQL on Windows, you can find precompiled binaries of
``psycopg`` at http://www.djangoproject.com/r/python-pgsql/windows/.

If you're on Linux, check whether your distribution's package-management
system offers a package called "python-psycopg2", "psycopg2-python",
"python-postgresql" or something similar.

Using Django with SQLite 3
--------------------------

You're in luck: no database-specific installation is required, because Python
ships with SQLite support. Skip ahead to the next section.

Using Django with MySQL
-----------------------

Django requires MySQL 4.0 or above. The 3.x versions don't support nested
subqueries and some other fairly standard SQL statements.

You'll also need to install the ``MySQLdb`` package from
http://www.djangoproject.com/r/python-mysql/.

If you're on Linux, check whether your distribution's package-management system
offers a package called "python-mysql", "python-mysqldb", "mysql-python" or
something similar.

Using Django with Oracle
------------------------

Django works with Oracle Database Server versions 9i and higher.

If you're using Oracle, you'll need to install the ``cx_Oracle`` library,
available at http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/. Use version 4.3.1 or higher, but
avoid version 5.0 due to a bug in that version of the driver.  Version 5.0.1
resolved the bug, however, so you can choose a higher version as well.

Using Django Without a Database
-------------------------------

As mentioned earlier, Django doesn't actually require a database. If you just
want to use it to serve dynamic pages that don't hit a database, that's
perfectly fine.

With that said, bear in mind that some of the extra tools bundled with Django
*do* require a database, so if you choose not to use a database, you'll miss
out on those features. (We highlight these features throughout this book.)

Starting a Project
==================

Once you've installed Python, Django and (optionally) your database
server/library, you can take the first step in developing a Django application
by creating a *project*.

A project is a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including
database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific
settings.

If this is your first time using Django, you'll have to take care of some
initial setup. Create a new directory to start working in, perhaps something
like ``/home/username/djcode/``.

.. admonition:: Where Should This Directory Live?

    If your background is in PHP, you're probably used to putting code under the
    Web server's document root (in a place such as ``/var/www``). With Django,
    you don't do that. It's not a good idea to put any of this Python code
    within your Web server's document root, because in doing so you risk the
    possibility that people will be able to view your raw source code over the
    Web. That's not good.

    Put your code in some directory **outside** of the document root.

Change into the directory you created, and run the command
``django-admin.py startproject mysite``. This will create a ``mysite``
directory in your current directory.

.. note::

    ``django-admin.py`` should be on your system path if you installed Django
    via its ``setup.py`` utility.

    If you're using the development version, you'll find ``django-admin.py`` in
    ``djmaster/django/bin``. Because you'll be using ``django-admin.py``
    often, consider adding it to your system path. On Unix, you can do so by
    symlinking from ``/usr/local/bin``, using a command such as ``sudo ln -s
    /path/to/django/bin/django-admin.py /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py``. On
    Windows, you'll need to update your ``PATH`` environment variable.

    If you installed Django from a packaged version for your Linux
    distribution, ``django-admin.py`` might be called ``django-admin`` instead.

If you see a "permission denied" message when running
``django-admin.py startproject``, you'll need to change the file's permissions.
To do this, navigate to the directory where ``django-admin.py`` is installed
(e.g., ``cd /usr/local/bin``) and run the command ``chmod +x django-admin.py``.

The ``startproject`` command creates a directory containing five files::

    mysite/
        manage.py
        mysite/
            __init__.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py

.. note:: Doesn't match what you see?

    The default project layout recently changed. If you're seeing a
    "flat" layout (with no inner ``mysite/`` directory), you're probably using
    a version of Django that doesn't match this tutorial version. This book covers
    Django 1.4 and above, so if you're using an older version you probably want to
    consult Django's official documentation.

    The documentation for Django 1.X version is available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.X/.

These files are as follows:

* ``mysite/``: The outer ``mysite/`` directory is just a container for your project.
  Its name doesn't matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.

* ``manage.py``: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this
  Django project in various ways. Type ``python manage.py help`` to get a
  feel for what it can do. You should never have to edit this file; it's
  created in this directory purely for convenience.

* ``mysite/mysite/``: The inner ``mysite/`` directory is the actual Python package
  for your project. Its name is the Python package name you'll need to use to
  import anything inside it (e.g. ``import mysite.settings``).

* ``__init__.py``: A file required for Python to treat the ``mysite``
  directory as a package (i.e., a group of Python modules). It's an empty
  file, and generally you won't add anything to it.

* ``settings.py``: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Take a
  look at it to get an idea of the types of settings available, along with
  their default values.

* ``urls.py``: The URLs for this Django project. Think of this as the
  "table of contents" of your Django-powered site.

* ``wsgi.py``: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible webservers to serve your project.
  See How to deploy with WSGI (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/wsgi/) for more details.

Despite their small size, these files already constitute a working Django
application.

Running the Development Server
------------------------------

For some more post-installation positive feedback, let's run the Django
development server to see our barebones application in action.

The Django development server (also called the "runserver" after the command
that launches it) is a built-in, lightweight Web server you can use while
developing your site. It's included with Django so you can develop your site
rapidly, without having to deal with configuring your production server (e.g.,
Apache) until you're ready for production. The development server watches your
code and automatically reloads it, making it easy for you to change your code
without needing to restart anything.

To start the server, change into your project container directory (``cd mysite``),
if you haven't already, and run this command::

    python manage.py runserver

You'll see something like this::

    Validating models...
    0 errors found.

    Django version 1.4.2, using settings 'mysite.settings'
    Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

This launches the server locally, on port 8000, accessible only to connections
from your own computer. Now that it's running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
with your Web browser. You might see a different Django version depending on
which version of Django you have installed. You'll see a "Welcome to Django" page shaded in a
pleasant pastel blue. It worked!

One final, important note about the development server is worth mentioning
before proceeding. Although this server is convenient for development, resist
the temptation to use it in anything resembling a production environment. The
development server can handle only a single request at a time reliably, and it
has not gone through a security audit of any sort. When the time comes to
launch your site, see Chapter 12 for information on how to deploy Django.

.. admonition:: Changing the Development Server's Host or Port

    By default, the ``runserver`` command starts the development server on port
    8000, listening only for local connections. If you want to change the
    server's port, pass it as a command-line argument::

        python manage.py runserver 8080

    By specifying an IP address, you can tell the server to allow non-local
    connections. This is especially helpful if you'd like to share a
    development site with other members of your team. The IP address
    ``0.0.0.0`` tells the server to listen on any network interface::

        python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

    When you've done this, other computers on your local network will be able
    to view your Django site by visiting your IP address in their Web browsers,
    e.g., http://192.168.1.103:8000/ . (Note that you'll have to consult your
    network settings to determine your IP address on the local network. Unix
    users, try running "ifconfig" in a command prompt to get this information.
    Windows users, try "ipconfig".)

What's Next?
============

Now that you have everything installed and the development server running,
you're ready to :doc: learn the basics `Chapter 3`_, of serving Web pages with Django.
