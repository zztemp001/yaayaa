URLconf Tricks
==============

There's nothing "special" about URLconfs -- like anything else in Django,
they're just Python code. You can take advantage of this in several ways, as
described in the sections that follow.

Streamlining Function Imports
-----------------------------

Consider this URLconf, which builds on the example in Chapter 3::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite.views import hello, current_datetime, hours_ahead

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^hello/$', hello),
        (r'^time/$', current_datetime),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', hours_ahead),
    )

As explained in Chapter 3, each entry in the URLconf includes its associated
view function, passed directly as a function object. This means it's necessary
to import the view functions at the top of the module.

But as a Django application grows in complexity, its URLconf grows, too, and
keeping those imports can be tedious to manage. (For each new view function,
you have to remember to import it, and the import statement tends to get
overly long if you use this approach.) It's possible to avoid that tedium by
importing the ``views`` module itself. This example URLconf is equivalent to
the previous one:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    **from mysite import views**

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^hello/$', **views.hello**),
        (r'^time/$', **views.current_datetime**),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', **views.hours_ahead**),
    )

Django offers another way of specifying the view function for a particular
pattern in the URLconf: you can pass a string containing the module name and
function name rather than the function object itself. Continuing the ongoing
example:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^hello/$', **'mysite.views.hello'**),
        (r'^time/$', **'mysite.views.current_datetime'**),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', **'mysite.views.hours_ahead'**),
    )

(Note the quotes around the view names. We're using
``'mysite.views.current_datetime'`` -- with quotes -- instead of
``mysite.views.current_datetime``.)

Using this technique, it's no longer necessary to import the view functions;
Django automatically imports the appropriate view function the first time it's
needed, according to the string describing the name and path of the view
function.

A further shortcut you can take when using the string technique is to factor
out a common "view prefix." In our URLconf example, each of the view strings
starts with ``'mysite.views'``, which is redundant to type. We can factor out
that common prefix and pass it as the first argument to ``patterns()``, like
this:

.. parsed-literal::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns(**'mysite.views'**,
        (r'^hello/$', **'hello'**),
        (r'^time/$', **'current_datetime'**),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', **'hours_ahead'**),
    )

Note that you don't put a trailing dot (``"."``) in the prefix, nor do you put
a leading dot in the view strings. Django puts those in automatically.

With these two approaches in mind, which is better? It really depends on your
personal coding style and needs.

Advantages of the string approach are as follows:

* It's more compact, because it doesn't require you to import the view
  functions.

* It results in more readable and manageable URLconfs if your view
  functions are spread across several different Python modules.

Advantages of the function object approach are as follows:

* It allows for easy "wrapping" of view functions. See the section "Wrapping View
  Functions" later in this chapter.

* It's more "Pythonic" -- that is, it's more in line with Python
  traditions, such as passing functions as objects.

Both approaches are valid, and you can even mix them within the same URLconf.
The choice is yours.

Using Multiple View Prefixes
----------------------------

In practice, if you use the string technique, you'll probably end up mixing
views to the point where the views in your URLconf won't have a common prefix.
However, you can still take advantage of the view prefix shortcut to
remove duplication. Just add multiple ``patterns()`` objects together, like
this:

Old::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^hello/$', 'mysite.views.hello'),
        (r'^time/$', 'mysite.views.current_datetime'),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', 'mysite.views.hours_ahead'),
        (r'^tag/(\w+)/$', 'weblog.views.tag'),
    )

New::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('mysite.views',
        (r'^hello/$', 'hello'),
        (r'^time/$', 'current_datetime'),
        (r'^time/plus/(\d{1,2})/$', 'hours_ahead'),
    )

    urlpatterns += patterns('weblog.views',
        (r'^tag/(\w+)/$', 'tag'),
    )

All the framework cares about is that there's a module-level variable called
``urlpatterns``. This variable can be constructed dynamically, as we do in this
example. We should specifically point out that the objects returned by
``patterns()`` can be added together, which is something you might not have
expected.

Special-Casing URLs in Debug Mode
---------------------------------

Speaking of constructing ``urlpatterns`` dynamically, you might want to take
advantage of this technique to alter your URLconf's behavior while in Django's
debug mode. To do this, just check the value of the ``DEBUG`` setting at
runtime, like so::

    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^$', views.homepage),
        (r'^(\d{4})/([a-z]{3})/$', views.archive_month),
    )

    if settings.DEBUG:
        urlpatterns += patterns('',
            (r'^debuginfo/$', views.debug),
        )

In this example, the URL ``/debuginfo/`` will only be available if your
``DEBUG`` setting is set to ``True``.

Using Named Groups
------------------

In all of our URLconf examples so far, we've used simple, *non-named*
regular expression groups -- that is, we put parentheses around parts of the URL
we wanted to capture, and Django passes that captured text to the view
function as a positional argument. In more advanced usage, it's possible to use
*named* regular expression groups to capture URL bits and pass them as
*keyword* arguments to a view.

.. admonition:: Keyword Arguments vs. Positional Arguments

    A Python function can be called using keyword arguments or positional
    arguments -- and, in some cases, both at the same time. In a keyword
    argument call, you specify the names of the arguments along with the values
    you're passing. In a positional argument call, you simply pass the
    arguments without explicitly specifying which argument matches which value;
    the association is implicit in the arguments' order.

    For example, consider this simple function::

        def sell(item, price, quantity):
            print "Selling %s unit(s) of %s at %s" % (quantity, item, price)

    To call it with positional arguments, you specify the arguments in the
    order in which they're listed in the function definition::

        sell('Socks', '$2.50', 6)

    To call it with keyword arguments, you specify the names of the arguments
    along with the values. The following statements are equivalent::

        sell(item='Socks', price='$2.50', quantity=6)
        sell(item='Socks', quantity=6, price='$2.50')
        sell(price='$2.50', item='Socks', quantity=6)
        sell(price='$2.50', quantity=6, item='Socks')
        sell(quantity=6, item='Socks', price='$2.50')
        sell(quantity=6, price='$2.50', item='Socks')

    Finally, you can mix keyword and positional arguments, as long as all
    positional arguments are listed before keyword arguments. The following
    statements are equivalent to the previous examples::

        sell('Socks', '$2.50', quantity=6)
        sell('Socks', price='$2.50', quantity=6)
        sell('Socks', quantity=6, price='$2.50')

In Python regular expressions, the syntax for named regular expression groups
is ``(?P<name>pattern)``, where ``name`` is the name of the group and
``pattern`` is some pattern to match.

Here's an example URLconf that uses non-named groups::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^articles/(\d{4})/$', views.year_archive),
        (r'^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    )

Here's the same URLconf, rewritten to use named groups::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^articles/(?P<year>\d{4})/$', views.year_archive),
        (r'^articles/(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>\d{2})/$', views.month_archive),
    )

This accomplishes exactly the same thing as the previous example, with one
subtle difference: the captured values are passed to view functions as keyword
arguments rather than positional arguments.

For example, with non-named groups, a request to ``/articles/2006/03/`` would
result in a function call equivalent to this::

    month_archive(request, '2006', '03')

With named groups, though, the same request would result in this function call::

    month_archive(request, year='2006', month='03')

In practice, using named groups makes your URLconfs slightly more explicit and
less prone to argument-order bugs -- and you can reorder the arguments in your
views' function definitions. Following the preceding example, if we wanted to
change the URLs to include the month *before* the year, and we were using
non-named groups, we'd have to remember to change the order of arguments in the
``month_archive`` view. If we were using named groups, changing the order of
the captured parameters in the URL would have no effect on the view.

Of course, the benefits of named groups come at the cost of brevity; some
developers find the named-group syntax ugly and too verbose. Still, another
advantage of named groups is readability, especially by those who aren't
intimately familiar with regular expressions or your particular Django
application. It's easier to see what's happening, at a glance, in a
URLconf that uses named groups.

Understanding the Matching/Grouping Algorithm
---------------------------------------------

A caveat with using named groups in a URLconf is that a single URLconf pattern
cannot contain both named and non-named groups. If you do this, Django won't
throw any errors, but you'll probably find that your URLs aren't matching as
you expect. Specifically, here's the algorithm the URLconf parser follows, with
respect to named groups vs. non-named groups in a regular expression:

* If there are any named arguments, it will use those, ignoring non-named
  arguments.

* Otherwise, it will pass all non-named arguments as positional arguments.

* In both cases, it will pass any extra options as keyword arguments. See
  the next section for more information.

Passing Extra Options to View Functions
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you'll find yourself writing view functions that are quite similar,
with only a few small differences. For example, say you have two views whose
contents are identical except for the template they use::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^foo/$', views.foo_view),
        (r'^bar/$', views.bar_view),
    )

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from mysite.models import MyModel

    def foo_view(request):
        m_list = MyModel.objects.filter(is_new=True)
        return render(request, 'template1.html', {'m_list': m_list})

    def bar_view(request):
        m_list = MyModel.objects.filter(is_new=True)
        return render(request, 'template2.html', {'m_list': m_list})

We're repeating ourselves in this code, and that's inelegant. At first, you
may think to remove the redundancy by using the same view for both URLs,
putting parentheses around the URL to capture it, and checking the URL within
the view to determine the template, like so::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^(foo)/$', views.foobar_view),
        (r'^(bar)/$', views.foobar_view),
    )

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from mysite.models import MyModel

    def foobar_view(request, url):
        m_list = MyModel.objects.filter(is_new=True)
        if url == 'foo':
            template_name = 'template1.html'
        elif url == 'bar':
            template_name = 'template2.html'
        return render(request, template_name, {'m_list': m_list})

The problem with that solution, though, is that it couples your URLs to your
code. If you decide to rename ``/foo/`` to ``/fooey/``, you'll have to remember
to change the view code.

The elegant solution involves an optional URLconf parameter. Each pattern in a
URLconf may include a third item: a dictionary of keyword arguments to pass
to the view function.

With this in mind, we can rewrite our ongoing example like this::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^foo/$', views.foobar_view, {'template_name': 'template1.html'}),
        (r'^bar/$', views.foobar_view, {'template_name': 'template2.html'}),
    )

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from mysite.models import MyModel

    def foobar_view(request, template_name):
        m_list = MyModel.objects.filter(is_new=True)
        return render(request, template_name, {'m_list': m_list})

As you can see, the URLconf in this example specifies ``template_name`` in the
URLconf. The view function treats it as just another parameter.

This extra URLconf options technique is a nice way of sending additional
information to your view functions with minimal fuss. As such, it's used by a
couple of Django's bundled applications, most notably its generic views system,
which we cover in Chapter 11.

The following sections contain a couple of ideas on how you can use the extra
URLconf options technique in your own projects.

Faking Captured URLconf Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Say you have a set of views that match a pattern, along with another URL that
doesn't fit the pattern but whose view logic is the same. In this case, you can
"fake" the capturing of URL values by using extra URLconf options to handle
that extra URL with the same view.

For example, you might have an application that displays some data for a
particular day, with URLs such as these::

    /mydata/jan/01/
    /mydata/jan/02/
    /mydata/jan/03/
    # ...
    /mydata/dec/30/
    /mydata/dec/31/

This is simple enough to deal with -- you can capture those in a URLconf like
this (using named group syntax)::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^mydata/(?P<month>\w{3})/(?P<day>\d\d)/$', views.my_view),
    )

And the view function signature would look like this::

    def my_view(request, month, day):
        # ....

This approach is straightforward -- it's nothing you haven't seen before. The trick comes
in when you want to add another URL that uses ``my_view`` but whose URL doesn't
include a ``month`` and/or ``day``.

For example, you might want to add another URL, ``/mydata/birthday/``, which
would be equivalent to ``/mydata/jan/06/``. You can take advantage of extra
URLconf options like so::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^mydata/birthday/$', views.my_view, {'month': 'jan', 'day': '06'}),
        (r'^mydata/(?P<month>\w{3})/(?P<day>\d\d)/$', views.my_view),
    )

The cool thing here is that you don't have to change your view function at all.
The view function only cares that it *gets* ``month`` and ``day`` parameters --
it doesn't matter whether they come from the URL capturing itself or extra
parameters.

Making a View Generic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's good programming practice to "factor out" commonalities in code. For
example, with these two Python functions::

    def say_hello(person_name):
        print 'Hello, %s' % person_name

    def say_goodbye(person_name):
        print 'Goodbye, %s' % person_name

we can factor out the greeting to make it a parameter::

    def greet(person_name, greeting):
        print '%s, %s' % (greeting, person_name)

You can apply this same philosophy to your Django views by using extra URLconf
parameters.

With this in mind, you can start making higher-level abstractions of your
views. Instead of thinking to yourself, "This view displays a list of ``Event``
objects," and "That view displays a list of ``BlogEntry`` objects," realize
they're both specific cases of "A view that displays a list of objects, where
the type of object is variable."

Take this code, for example::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^events/$', views.event_list),
        (r'^blog/entries/$', views.entry_list),
    )

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from mysite.models import Event, BlogEntry

    def event_list(request):
        obj_list = Event.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'mysite/event_list.html', {'event_list': obj_list})

    def entry_list(request):
        obj_list = BlogEntry.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'mysite/blogentry_list.html', {'entry_list': obj_list})

The two views do essentially the same thing: they display a list of objects. So
let's factor out the type of object they're displaying::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import models, views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^events/$', views.object_list, {'model': models.Event}),
        (r'^blog/entries/$', views.object_list, {'model': models.BlogEntry}),
    )

    # views.py

    from django.shortcuts import render

    def object_list(request, model):
        obj_list = model.objects.all()
        template_name = 'mysite/%s_list.html' % model.__name__.lower()
        return render(request, template_name, {'object_list': obj_list})

With those small changes, we suddenly have a reusable, model-agnostic view!
From now on, anytime we need a view that lists a set of objects, we can simply
reuse this ``object_list`` view rather than writing view code. Here are a
couple of notes about what we did:

* We're passing the model classes directly, as the ``model`` parameter. The
  dictionary of extra URLconf options can pass any type of Python object --
  not just strings.

* The ``model.objects.all()`` line is an example of *duck typing*: "If it
  walks like a duck and talks like a duck, we can treat it like a duck."
  Note the code doesn't know what type of object ``model`` is; the only
  requirement is that ``model`` have an ``objects`` attribute, which in
  turn has an ``all()`` method.

* We're using ``model.__name__.lower()`` in determining the template name.
  Every Python class has a ``__name__`` attribute that returns the class
  name. This feature is useful at times like this, when we don't know the
  type of class until runtime. For example, the ``BlogEntry`` class's
  ``__name__`` is the string ``'BlogEntry'``.

* In a slight difference between this example and the previous example,
  we're passing the generic variable name ``object_list`` to the template.
  We could easily change this variable name to be ``blogentry_list`` or
  ``event_list``, but we've left that as an exercise for the reader.

Because database-driven Web sites have several common patterns, Django comes
with a set of "generic views" that use this exact technique to save you time.
We cover Django's built-in generic views in Chapter 11.

Giving a View Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're distributing a Django application, chances are that your users will
want some degree of configuration. In this case, it's a good idea to add hooks
to your views for any configuration options you think people may want to
change. You can use extra URLconf parameters for this purpose.

A common bit of an application to make configurable is the template name::

    def my_view(request, template_name):
        var = do_something()
        return render(request, template_name, {'var': var})

Understanding Precedence of Captured Values vs. Extra Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When there's a conflict, extra URLconf parameters get precedence over captured
parameters. In other words, if your URLconf captures a named-group variable and
an extra URLconf parameter includes a variable with the same name, the extra
URLconf parameter value will be used.

For example, consider this URLconf::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^mydata/(?P<id>\d+)/$', views.my_view, {'id': 3}),
    )

Here, both the regular expression and the extra dictionary include an ``id``.
The hard-coded ``id`` gets precedence. That means any request (e.g.,
``/mydata/2/`` or ``/mydata/432432/``) will be treated as if ``id`` is set
to ``3``, regardless of the value captured in the URL.

Astute readers will note that in this case, it's a waste of time and typing to
capture the ``id`` in the regular expression, because its value will always be
overridden by the dictionary's value. That's correct; we bring this up only to
help you avoid making the mistake.

Using Default View Arguments
----------------------------

Another convenient trick is to specify default parameters for a view's
arguments. This tells the view which value to use for a parameter by default if
none is specified.

An example::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^blog/$', views.page),
        (r'^blog/page(?P<num>\d+)/$', views.page),
    )

    # views.py

    def page(request, num='1'):
        # Output the appropriate page of blog entries, according to num.
        # ...

Here, both URL patterns point to the same view -- ``views.page`` -- but the
first pattern doesn't capture anything from the URL. If the first pattern
matches, the ``page()`` function will use its default argument for ``num``,
``'1'``. If the second pattern matches, ``page()`` will use whatever ``num``
value was captured by the regular expression.

(Note that we've been careful to set the default argument's value to the
*string* ``'1'``, not the integer ``1``. That's for consistency, because
any captured value for ``num`` will always be a string.)

It's common to use this technique in conjunction with configuration options,
as explained earlier. This example makes a slight improvement to the example in
the "Giving a View Configuration Options" section by providing a default
value for ``template_name``::

    def my_view(request, template_name='mysite/my_view.html'):
        var = do_something()
        return render(request, template_name, {'var': var})

.. SL Again wonder whether default should be unicode?

Special-Casing Views
--------------------

Sometimes you'll have a pattern in your URLconf that handles a large set of
URLs, but you'll need to special-case one of them. In this case, take advantage
of the linear way a URLconf is processed and put the special case first.

For example, you can think of the "add an object" pages in Django's admin site
as represented by a URLpattern like this::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        ('^([^/]+)/([^/]+)/add/$', views.add_stage),
        # ...
    )

This matches URLs such as ``/myblog/entries/add/`` and ``/auth/groups/add/``.
However, the "add" page for a user object (``/auth/user/add/``) is a special
case -- it doesn't display all of the form fields, it displays two password
fields, and so forth. We *could* solve this problem by special-casing in the
view, like so::

    def add_stage(request, app_label, model_name):
        if app_label == 'auth' and model_name == 'user':
            # do special-case code
        else:
            # do normal code

.. SL It's not strictly relevant to the point you're making here, but
.. SL the view func in the admin is now called 'add_view'

but that's inelegant for a reason we've touched on multiple times in this
chapter: it puts URL logic in the view. As a more elegant solution, we can take
advantage of the fact that URLconfs are processed in order from top to bottom::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        ('^auth/user/add/$', views.user_add_stage),
        ('^([^/]+)/([^/]+)/add/$', views.add_stage),
        # ...
    )

With this in place, a request to ``/auth/user/add/`` will be handled by the
``user_add_stage`` view. Although that URL matches the second pattern, it
matches the top one first. (This is short-circuit logic.)

Capturing Text in URLs
----------------------

Each captured argument is sent to the view as a plain Python Unicode string,
regardless of what sort of match the regular expression makes. For example, in
this URLconf line::

    (r'^articles/(?P<year>\d{4})/$', views.year_archive),

the ``year`` argument to ``views.year_archive()`` will be a string, not
an integer, even though ``\d{4}`` will only match integer strings.

This is important to keep in mind when you're writing view code. Many built-in
Python functions are fussy (and rightfully so) about accepting only objects of
a certain type. A common error is to attempt to create a ``datetime.date``
object with string values instead of integer values::

    >>> import datetime
    >>> datetime.date('1993', '7', '9')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: an integer is required
    >>> datetime.date(1993, 7, 9)
    datetime.date(1993, 7, 9)

Translated to a URLconf and view, the error looks like this::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d{2})/$', views.day_archive),
    )

    # views.py

    import datetime

    def day_archive(request, year, month, day):
        # The following statement raises a TypeError!
        date = datetime.date(year, month, day)

Instead, ``day_archive()`` can be written correctly like this::

    def day_archive(request, year, month, day):
        date = datetime.date(int(year), int(month), int(day))

Note that ``int()`` itself raises a ``ValueError`` when you pass it a string
that is not composed solely of digits, but we're avoiding that error in this
case because the regular expression in our URLconf has ensured that only
strings containing digits are passed to the view function.

Determining What the URLconf Searches Against
---------------------------------------------

When a request comes in, Django tries to match the URLconf patterns against the
requested URL, as a Python string. This does not include ``GET`` or ``POST``
parameters, or the domain name. It also does not include the leading slash,
because every URL has a leading slash.

For example, in a request to ``http://www.example.com/myapp/``, Django will try
to match ``myapp/``. In a request to ``http://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3``,
Django will try to match ``myapp/``.

The request method (e.g., ``POST``, ``GET``) is *not* taken into account when
traversing the URLconf. In other words, all request methods will be routed to
the same function for the same URL. It's the responsibility of a view function
to perform branching based on request method.

Higher-Level Abstractions of View Functions
-------------------------------------------

And speaking of branching based on request method, let's take a look at how we
might build a nice way of doing that. Consider this URLconf/view layout::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        (r'^somepage/$', views.some_page),
        # ...
    )

    # views.py

    from django.http import Http404, HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def some_page(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            do_something_for_post()
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/someurl/')
        elif request.method == 'GET':
            do_something_for_get()
            return render(request, 'page.html')
        else:
            raise Http404()

In this example, the ``some_page()`` view's handling of ``POST`` vs. ``GET``
requests is quite different. The only thing they have in common is a shared
URL: ``/somepage/``. As such, it's kind of inelegant to deal with both ``POST``
and ``GET`` in the same view function. It would be nice if we could have two
separate view functions -- one handling ``GET`` requests and the other handling
``POST`` -- and ensuring each one was only called when appropriate.

We can do that by writing a view function that delegates to other views,
either before or after executing some custom logic. Here's an example of how
this technique could help simplify our ``some_page()`` view::

    # views.py

    from django.http import Http404, HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def method_splitter(request, GET=None, POST=None):
        if request.method == 'GET' and GET is not None:
            return GET(request)
        elif request.method == 'POST' and POST is not None:
            return POST(request)
        raise Http404

    def some_page_get(request):
        assert request.method == 'GET'
        do_something_for_get()
        return render(request, 'page.html')

    def some_page_post(request):
        assert request.method == 'POST'
        do_something_for_post()
        return HttpResponseRedirect('/someurl/')

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite import views

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # ...
        (r'^somepage/$', views.method_splitter, {'GET': views.some_page_get, 'POST': views.some_page_post}),
        # ...
    )

Let's go through what this does:

* We've written a new view, ``method_splitter()``, that delegates to other
  views based on ``request.method``. It looks for two keyword arguments,
  ``GET`` and ``POST``, which should be *view functions*. If
  ``request.method`` is ``'GET'``, then it calls the ``GET`` view. If
  ``request.method`` is ``'POST'``, then it calls the ``POST`` view. If
  ``request.method`` is something else (``HEAD``, etc.), or if ``GET`` or
  ``POST`` were not supplied to the function, then it raises an
  ``Http404``.

* In the URLconf, we point ``/somepage/`` at ``method_splitter()`` and pass
  it extra arguments -- the view functions to use for ``GET`` and ``POST``,
  respectively.

* Finally, we've split the ``some_page()`` view into two view functions --
  ``some_page_get()`` and ``some_page_post()``. This is much nicer than
  shoving all of that logic into a single view.

  Note that these view functions technically no longer have to check
  ``request.method``, because ``method_splitter()`` does that. (By the time
  ``some_page_post()`` is called, for example, we can be confident
  ``request.method`` is ``'post'``.) Still, just to be safe, and also to
  serve as documentation, we stuck in an ``assert`` that makes sure
  ``request.method`` is what we expect it to be.

Now we have ourselves a nice, generic view function that encapsulates the logic
of delegating a view by ``request.method``. Nothing about ``method_splitter()``
is tied to our specific application, of course, so we can reuse it in other
projects.

But, while we're at it, there's one way to improve on ``method_splitter()``.
As it's written, it assumes that the ``GET`` and ``POST`` views take no
arguments other than ``request``. What if we wanted to use
``method_splitter()`` with views that, for example, capture text from URLs,
or take optional keyword arguments themselves?

To do that, we can use a nice Python feature: variable arguments with
asterisks. We'll show the example first, then explain it::

    def method_splitter(request, *args, **kwargs):
        get_view = kwargs.pop('GET', None)
        post_view = kwargs.pop('POST', None)
        if request.method == 'GET' and get_view is not None:
            return get_view(request, *args, **kwargs)
        elif request.method == 'POST' and post_view is not None:
            return post_view(request, *args, **kwargs)
        raise Http404

Here, we've refactored ``method_splitter()`` to remove the ``GET`` and ``POST``
keyword arguments, in favor of ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` (note the asterisks).
This is a Python feature that allows a function to accept a dynamic, arbitrary
number of arguments whose names aren't known until runtime. If you put a single
asterisk in front of a parameter in a function definition, any *positional*
arguments to that function will be rolled up into a single tuple. If you put
two asterisks in front of a parameter in a function definition, any *keyword*
arguments to that function will be rolled up into a single dictionary.

For example, with this function::

    def foo(*args, **kwargs):
        print "Positional arguments are:"
        print args
        print "Keyword arguments are:"
        print kwargs

Here's how it would work::

    >>> foo(1, 2, 3)
    Positional arguments are:
    (1, 2, 3)
    Keyword arguments are:
    {}
    >>> foo(1, 2, name='Adrian', framework='Django')
    Positional arguments are:
    (1, 2)
    Keyword arguments are:
    {'framework': 'Django', 'name': 'Adrian'}

.. SL Tested ok

Bringing this back to ``method_splitter()``, you can see we're using ``*args``
and ``**kwargs`` to accept *any* arguments to the function and pass them along
to the appropriate view. But before we do that, we make two calls to
``kwargs.pop()`` to get the ``GET`` and ``POST`` arguments, if they're
available. (We're using ``pop()`` with a default value of ``None`` to avoid
``KeyError`` if one or the other isn't defined.)

Wrapping View Functions
-----------------------

Our final view trick takes advantage of an advanced Python technique. Say you
find yourself repeating a bunch of code throughout various views, as in this
example::

    def my_view1(request):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated():
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/accounts/login/')
        # ...
        return render(request, 'template1.html')

    def my_view2(request):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated():
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/accounts/login/')
        # ...
        return render(request, 'template2.html')

    def my_view3(request):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated():
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/accounts/login/')
        # ...
        return render(request, 'template3.html')

Here, each view starts by checking that ``request.user`` is authenticated
-- that is, the current user has successfully logged into the site -- and
redirects to ``/accounts/login/`` if not. (Note that we haven't yet covered
``request.user`` -- Chapter 14 does -- but, as you might imagine,
``request.user`` represents the current user, either logged-in or anonymous.)

It would be nice if we could remove that bit of repetitive code from each of
these views and just mark them as requiring authentication. We can do that by
making a view wrapper. Take a moment to study this::

    def requires_login(view):
        def new_view(request, *args, **kwargs):
            if not request.user.is_authenticated():
                return HttpResponseRedirect('/accounts/login/')
            return view(request, *args, **kwargs)
        return new_view

This function, ``requires_login``, takes a view function (``view``) and returns
a new view function (``new_view``). The new function, ``new_view`` is defined
*within* ``requires_login`` and handles the logic of checking
``request.user.is_authenticated()`` and delegating to the original view
(``view``).

Now, we can remove the ``if not request.user.is_authenticated()`` checks from
our views and simply wrap them with ``requires_login`` in our URLconf::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from mysite.views import requires_login, my_view1, my_view2, my_view3

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^view1/$', requires_login(my_view1)),
        (r'^view2/$', requires_login(my_view2)),
        (r'^view3/$', requires_login(my_view3)),
    )

This has the same effect as before, but with less code redundancy. Now we've
created a nice, generic function -- ``requires_login()`` that we can wrap
around any view in order to make it require login.

Including Other URLconfs
========================

If you intend your code to be used on multiple Django-based sites, you should
consider arranging your URLconfs in such a way that allows for "including."

At any point, your URLconf can "include" other URLconf modules. This
essentially "roots" a set of URLs below other ones. For example, this
URLconf includes other URLconfs::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^weblog/', include('mysite.blog.urls')),
        (r'^photos/', include('mysite.photos.urls')),
        (r'^about/$', 'mysite.views.about'),
    )

(We saw this before in Chapter 6, when we introduced the Django admin site. The
admin site has its own URLconf that you merely ``include()`` within yours.)

There's an important gotcha here: the regular expressions in this example that
point to an ``include()`` do *not* have a ``$`` (end-of-string match character)
but *do* include a trailing slash. Whenever Django encounters ``include()``, it
chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the
remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.

Continuing this example, here's the URLconf ``mysite.blog.urls``::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^(\d\d\d\d)/$', 'mysite.blog.views.year_detail'),
        (r'^(\d\d\d\d)/(\d\d)/$', 'mysite.blog.views.month_detail'),
    )

With these two URLconfs, here's how a few sample requests would be handled:

* ``/weblog/2007/``: In the first URLconf, the pattern ``r'^weblog/'``
  matches. Because it is an ``include()``, Django strips all the matching
  text, which is ``'weblog/'`` in this case. The remaining part of the URL
  is ``2007/``, which matches the first line in the ``mysite.blog.urls``
  URLconf.

* ``/weblog//2007/`` (with two slashes): In the first URLconf, the pattern
  ``r'^weblog/'`` matches. Because it is an ``include()``, Django strips
  all the matching text, which is ``'weblog/'`` in this case. The remaining
  part of the URL is ``/2007/`` (with a leading slash), which does not
  match any of the lines in the ``mysite.blog.urls`` URLconf.

* ``/about/``: This matches the view ``mysite.views.about`` in the first
  URLconf, demonstrating that you can mix ``include()`` patterns with
  non-``include()`` patterns.

How Captured Parameters Work with include()
-------------------------------------------

An included URLconf receives any captured parameters from parent URLconfs, for
example::

    # root urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^(?P<username>\w+)/blog/', include('foo.urls.blog')),
    )

    # foo/urls/blog.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^$', 'foo.views.blog_index'),
        (r'^archive/$', 'foo.views.blog_archive'),
    )

In this example, the captured ``username`` variable is passed to the
included URLconf and, hence, to *every* view function within that URLconf.

Note that the captured parameters will *always* be passed to *every* line in
the included URLconf, regardless of whether the line's view actually accepts
those parameters as valid. For this reason, this technique is useful only if
you're certain that every view in the included URLconf accepts the
parameters you're passing.

How Extra URLconf Options Work with include()
---------------------------------------------

Similarly, you can pass extra URLconf options to ``include()``, just as you can
pass extra URLconf options to a normal view -- as a dictionary. When you do
this, *each* line in the included URLconf will be passed the extra options.

For example, the following two URLconf sets are functionally identical.

Set one::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^blog/', include('inner'), {'blogid': 3}),
    )

    # inner.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^archive/$', 'mysite.views.archive'),
        (r'^about/$', 'mysite.views.about'),
        (r'^rss/$', 'mysite.views.rss'),
    )

Set two::

    # urls.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^blog/', include('inner')),
    )

    # inner.py

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        (r'^archive/$', 'mysite.views.archive', {'blogid': 3}),
        (r'^about/$', 'mysite.views.about', {'blogid': 3}),
        (r'^rss/$', 'mysite.views.rss', {'blogid': 3}),
    )

As is the case with captured parameters (explained in the previous section),
extra options will *always* be passed to *every* line in the included
URLconf, regardless of whether the line's view actually accepts those options
as valid. For this reason, this technique is useful only if you're certain that
every view in the included URLconf accepts the extra options you're passing.
